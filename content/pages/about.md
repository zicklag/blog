I'm a self-taught software & DevOps engineer with a passion for producing high quality solutions to real-world problems. I pick up new languages and ecosystems quickly and have recently been developing the [Jumpy] game and the [Bones] meta-engine!

I'm the Chief Technology Lead at [Katharos Technology](https://katharostech.com), where we try to devevelop technology that is pure and uplifting. The most important thing in my life is my God and Father to whom I owe everything.
